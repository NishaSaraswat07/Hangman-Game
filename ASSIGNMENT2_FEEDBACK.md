Hi Nisha!

Works perfecly, very clean and efficient code, and very easy to read.

The only advice I can give is that using a break inside a while loop is a little unusual since whiles will break anyway when the condition is false. You can have as many conditions you like (provided you have declared the variables before the loop starts) -

while (userInput != null && lives > 0 && remainingLetters > 0) // breaks if any of these are false

Then you can test these after the loop has ended to decide what to show the user.

But what you have is great. 10/10 and Välgodkänt. Well done!
